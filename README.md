- In addition to text explanation, the code is also fully commented to assist coders in understanding each statement. 
- Set `DEBUG` to `True` and you can then visualize the logic as the code executes. 
- Any method (Two-Pointer and Three-Pointer) can be chosen by setting `METHOD` to `1`, `2` or `3`.
